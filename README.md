# AML.GRN.modeling


In this repository are scripts and input files corresponding to the manuscript "Data-driven modeling of core gene regulatory network underlying leukemogenesis in IDH mutant AML," currently under review.

The purpose of the code is to integrate transcription-factor (TF)-target interactions from literature-based databases and from analysis of ATAC-seq data into candidate gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which are optimized to maximally fit experimental gene expression data while retaining the flexibility to permit state transitions.

For a detailed overview of the code and pipeline, see the manuscript [link TBD] and the included file README-technical-summary.docx.
